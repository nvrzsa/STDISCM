How to Run This Project

Project Structure:
- var1/ - Variant 1 with optimized config
- var2/ - Variant 2 with optimized config  
- var3/ - Variant 3 with optimized config
- var4/ - Variant 4 with optimized config

Build Commands (run in each folder):
cd var1
g++ -std=c++17 -o variant1.exe variant1.cpp -pthread

cd ..\var2
g++ -std=c++17 -o variant2.exe variant2.cpp -pthread

cd ..\var3
g++ -std=c++17 -o variant3.exe variant3.cpp -pthread

cd ..\var4
g++ -std=c++17 -o variant4.exe variant4.cpp -pthread

Run Commands (each folder has its own config):
cd var1
.\variant1.exe

cd ..\var2
.\variant2.exe

cd ..\var3
.\variant3.exe

cd ..\var4
.\variant4.exe

Variant Descriptions:
- Variant 1: Range Division / Immediate Print (shows interleaved output)
- Variant 2: Range Division / Batched Print (waits for all threads, then prints)
- Variant 3: Number Division / Immediate Print (producer-consumer with immediate output)
- Variant 4: Number Division / Batched Print (producer-consumer with batched output)

Demo Setup:
Each folder contains pre-configured settings optimized for demonstration.
No need to modify config files - just run each variant in its respective folder.
All variants include execution time measurements for performance comparison.
